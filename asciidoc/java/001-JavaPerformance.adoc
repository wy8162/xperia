== Performance Tuning Tips

. Don't optimize before you know it's necessary::
* Follow best practices to implement use cases efficiently.
* Premature optimization takes up a lot of time and makes the code hard to read and maintain.
* It's waste of time optimizing non-critical parts of applications.
* Define KPI like Response Per Second (RPS), TPS (Transactions Per Seconf) before optimization.
* Measure which parts of applications need improve.

. Use Profiler to find the real bottlenet::
* Based on findings from #1, decide where to start.
** Review the source code.
** Use Profiler to get details about the behavior and performance of each part of the code.
** Focus on the most critical parts first.

. Create a performance test suite for the whole application
* Define a test performance suite.
* Always run the suite before and after performance improvement.
+
These tests will help identify the functional and performance side effects after changes.

. Work on the biggest bottleneck first::
Rather than being tempted to start with quick wins, start from the most significant performance first.

. Use StringBuilder to programmatically add new contents to String::
* Better performance than StringBuffer
* But #not thread safe#

. Use "+" to concatenate Strings in one statements
* Strings are immutable
* Compiler will optimize String concatenate like "A" + "B" + "C".

. Use Primitives where possible::
* Less memory and faster

. Try to avoid BigInteger and BigDecimal
* Occupies more memory and slower than primitives

. Use the right log level
* Avoid creating String messages which ends up being ignored.
+
Do this: `if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {....}`

. Use Apache StringUtils.replace instead of String.replace because Apache has better performance.::

. Cache expensive resources like database connections::

. Use laziness if possible::

. Optimize database SQLs::
* Efficient execution of SQLs.
* Use hints.
* Use placeholders for parameters so that SQLs can be precompiled.
* Use stored procedures if possible.
* Retrieve data needed.
* Avoid race condition and dead lock.
* Don't lock if it is read only operation.
* Be cautious whenever run SQL using DISTINCT key word.
* Understand the indexes created on the table. Avoid #full table# scan.
*

. Scale out via process model::

. Multithreading::
* Use the full power and capacity allowed
* Avoid dead lock or race condition - Race conditions occurs when 2 or more threads operate on same object without proper synchronization and the steps on the operation interleaves on other thread.
* Avoid starvation - When a thread is not granted CPU time because other threads were using it all, it is called starvation.

. Fine tuning JVM parameters::
* Memory usage.
* Garbage collection algorithms.

== Tuning Performance Architecturally
Key areas to look at::
. UI server being deployed separately
. Cluster of servers
. Backup and load balance for better performance and reliability
. Prefer scaling out to scaling up

Performance test to collect data::
. CPU usage on application server and database
. Network utilization and latency
. Storage load
. Database AWR report
. Java Garbage Collection statistics
. System throughput numbers
. Java thread dumps
. Oracle error log

|IV. Backing services
|Treat backing services as attached resources

|V. Build, release, run
|Strictly separate build and run stages

|VI. Processes
|Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

|VII. Port binding
|Export services via port binding

|VIII. Concurrency
|Scale out via the process model

|IX. Disposability
|Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

|X. Dev/prod parity
|Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

|XI. Logs
|Treat logs as event streams

|XII. Admin processes
