== Web Architecture
. Client server.
. Uniform interface - each URI uniquely represent a resource.
. Layered system.
. Stateless.
. Code-on-demand - transfer executable program or script to client side on demand.

NOTE: REST - Representational State Transfer

NOTE: REST API - exposes a set of data and functions to facilitate the interactions between the computer programs and allow them to exchange information.

.SOAP vs RESTful
[NOTE]
====
|===
|SOAP |REST

|A XML based message protocol
|An architectural style representational state transfer

|WSDL used for communication between consumer and provider
|JSON, XML, text, CSV or other formats are supported

|Invokes services by calling RPC method
|Calls services via URL path

|Transfer over HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc.
|Mainly HTTP. Not necessarily have to be HTTP.

|Slower and large overhead (XML)
|Fast and lightweight (JSON)

|Function driven - transfer structured information
|Data driven: access to resource for data

|WS-security and SSL
|SSL and HTTPS

|Can't be cached
|Can be cached

|Strict communication contract. Needs knowledge of everything before interaction.
|Needs no knowledge of the API.

|Defines standards to be strictly followed
|Not too much standards

== REST API Design

.Questions to be addressed
[NOTE]
====
. When should URI path segments be named with plural nouns?
. Which request method should be used to update resource state?
. How do I map non-CRUD operations to my URI?
. What is the approriate HTTP response status code for a given scenario?
. How can I manage the versions of a resource's state representations?
. How should I structure a hyperlink in JSON?
====

.URI Format
[NOTE]
====
URI = scheme "://" authority "/" path ["?" query]["#" fragment]
====

URI Design Rules::
. "/" must be used to indicate a hierarchical relationship between resources. I.e. http://api.y.com/shapes/polygons/squares
. No trailing "/" should be included. Should be ignored if it is included.
. "-", hyphens, should be used to improve readability.
. Avoid underscore, "_".
. Use lowercase letters for URI paths.
. File extensions should not be used in URIs.

URI Authority Design::
. Consistent sub-domain names.
. Consistent sub-domain names for client developer portal. Many REST APIs have an associated website, known as a developer portal, to help on-board new clients with documentations, forums, and self-service provisioning of secure API access keys. I.e. http://developer.restapi.org .

Resource Modeling::
The hierarchy of resource models is represented by the URI path. The segments of the paths separated by "/" correspond to a unique resource.

Resource Archetypes:::
A REST API is composed of four distinct resource archetypes: document, collection, store and controller.

Document::::
A #document# resource is a singular concept that is akin to an object instance or database record, which can have fields with values and links to other related resources.

Collection::::
A #collection# resource is a server-managed directory of resources. It's the server's role to decide whether or not to add a new resource if ever requested by a client.

Store::::
A #store# is a client managed resource repository. A resource can be put into the store, be retrieved or deleted. But stores do not create new resources.

NOTE: PUT /users/1234/membership

Controller::::
A controller is an action that a client can perform. Controller names should appear as the last segment in the URI path.

NOTE: POST /notes/12345/alarm

== REST API URI Path Design

.#WRML# URI Pattern
[NOTE]
====
{collection}/{store}/{document}
Collection contains stores which keep documents.
====

. Document names - #singular noun#
. Collection names - #plural noun#
. Store names - #plural noun#
. Controller - verbs
. Path variable segments can be substituted with ID based values. I.e. http://api.foo.com/sportclubs/{clubId}/members/{memberId}
. Avoid CRUD function names in URIs.

== URI Query Design

.URI Query Patterm
[NOTE]
====
URI = scheme "://" authority "/" path [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

http://api.foo.com/orders/order12345/ship?delivery=ground
====

. Query can be used to filter collections and stores.
. Query can be used to paginate. I.e. GET /orders?pageStart=100&pageSize=50

== Interaction Design
. GET for retrieving resource
. HEAD for retrieve response headers only
. PUT to insert or update
. POST to create new resources in #collection#
. POST to execute #controller#
. DELETE to remove resource

== Typical Response Code
Use specific response code.

. 200 - OK, for non-specific success
. 201 - Created
. 202 - Accepted
. 204 - No content, for PUT, POST and DELETE.
. 301 - Moved permanently
. 400 - Bad request
. 401 - Unauthorized
. 403 - Forbidden
. 404 - Not found

== Meta Data Design
. Use Content-Type
. Use Content-Length
. Use Last-Modified
. ETag for responses
. Media Types

== Versioning

Versioning when there are changes in::
. format of response data
. type of response
. removal of any part of API

Versioning options::
. URI versioning. I.e., http://api.foo.com/v1
. Request Header - custom header like Accept-version
. Vendor specific accept header. I.e. Accept: application/vnd.example+json;version=1.0


== GitHub API
Good example for API design.
