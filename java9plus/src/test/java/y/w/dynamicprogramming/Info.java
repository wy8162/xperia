/**
 * Dynamic programming amounts to breaking down an optimization problem
 * into simpler sub-problems, and storing the solution to each sub-problem
 * so that each sub-problem is only solved once.
 *
 * Jonathan Paulson explains Dynamic Programming in his amazing Quora
 * answer here.
 *
 * Writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper.
 * "What's that equal to?"
 * Counting "Eight!"
 * Writes down another "1+" on the left.
 * "What about that?"
 * "Nine!" " How'd you know it was nine so fast?"
 * "You just added one more!"
 * "So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were
 * eight! Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say remembering
 * stuff to save time later!"
